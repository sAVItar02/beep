### Route Information
Use the button on the top left of the page to navigate to different pages.

#### Type 1
This component sets the margin and the padding of the spacing component itself.

Type in any of the input boxes to set that specific value. Input is live validated and prompts the user for correct input via appropriate border colors. 
For the changes to take effect, either press enter or click somewhere on the page (i.e. let the input lose focus).
Alternatively, use dropdown to modify all values of the same kind. 
#### Type 2
This component sets the margin and the padding of another dummy component made for demo purposes.

--------------------------

To validate the inputs, manually written regex was used which allows almost all commonly used css units. 

The regex is in the CONSTANTS.js file
